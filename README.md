# Multilevel-and-Multioutput-ML-model

The aim of this project is to develop a model which uses machine learning that will
be used to extract molecular information from text.
This text consists of a series of classifications and protocols that are in the ESPOQ data source
when a chemotherapy treatment is administered to the patient.

It has been possible to develop a multilevel and multioutput
model with crossvalidation to extract information from molecular markers with a good precision
of around 94%.
